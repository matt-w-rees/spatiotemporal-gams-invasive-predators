<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Study area</h2>
<p>We collated camera-trap data on these two predator species from three distinct studies across two regions of south-west Victoria, Australia (Fig. 1). The purpose of each study was to experimentally survey changes in the mammalian community due to fox control, and so our dataset covered a wide range contexts with and without fox-baiting, allowing us to investigate fox-cat interactions across a gradient of apex predator (fox) activity.</p>
<p>The terrestrial mammalian predator guild is depauperate throughout both regions. Dingoes <em>Canis familiaris</em> are now absent throughout, as is the the tiger quoll <em>Dasyurus maculatus</em>, more recently absent in the Otway Ranges (last sighted in 2014 despite extensive camera-trapping). Introduced red foxes and feral cats are therefore the only medium-large functional mammalian terrestrial predators across both regions.</p>
<p>In the baited parts of the regions, government land managers conduct ongoing targeted fox control for biodiversity conservation. Poison baits containing 3 mg of sodium mono-fluroacetate (1080) are buried at a depth of 10 cm at 1-km intervals along accessible forest tracks and roads.</p>
<p>In the Glenelg region, Gunditjmara country, natural vegetation is highly fragmented. Here, camera-survey sites were situated in six distinct forest blocks: two are separated by a river, the others are separated by at least <em>XX</em> km of pastoral farming and residential property. Foxes in three of the forest blocks have been subject to lethal control since October 2005, with 1080 poison-baits replaced fortnightly <span class="citation">(Robley et al. 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>The Otway Ranges, Gadubanud country, is a largely continuous patch of natural vegetation with a strong east-west rainfall and elevation gradient <span class="citation">(Swan et al. 2021)</span>. Foxes are controlled through 1080 poison-baits with monthly replacement across most of the Otway Ranges, but a large section to the north-west remains unbaited. The majority of this baiting began in 2016 - 2017, although fox-baiting commenced in some small sections in 2008.</p>
<p>Alongside fragmentation, the extremely rugged, wet forest and rainforest matrix in the western Otway Ranges is the main difference between the two regions. Prescribed fire, primarily for the purpose of asset protection, is another key management action undertaken throughout both regions (except in very wet sections of Otway Ranges).</p>
</div>
<div id="camera-trap-surveys" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Camera-trap surveys</h2>
<p>We compiled camera-trap data from three distinct studies across the two regions. After removing camera-traps which were operational for less than 14 days, this totalled 3659 deployments of camera-traps at 1232 camera-trap sites. Survey durations ranged between 14 and 93 days (mean 47), totalling 171,966 trapnights. Camera-trap spacing was variable; the average minimum distance between simultaneously deployed camera-traps was 445, 853 and 1266 metres for each study. Camera-trap were deployed in the Glenelg region between 2013 – 2019, whereas in the Otway Ranges surveys were conducted in 2016 – 2019.</p>
<p>All camera-trap deployments consisted of a Reconyx (Holmen, Wisconsin) brand camera-trap (both white and infrared flashes), attached to a tree or a metal picket, facing a lure. Camera-traps were set-up in two ways depending on the key aim of the project, either targeted toward predators or prey species. One study across both regions positioned camera-traps lower on a tree (around 15 - 30 cm above the ground – angled only slightly downwards) facing a tuna oil lure approximately 2 - 2.5 m away <span class="citation">(detailed in Rees et al. 2019)</span>. The remaining camera-traps were positioned higher on a tree or a metal picket (at least 40 cm above ground) and angled downwards more strongly - facing a lure approximately 1 - 1.5 m away. These lures consisted of peanut butter, golden syrup and rolled oats mixed into a small ball, placed within a tea strainer or PVC pipe container and secured either to the ground, or 20 - 60 cm above ground on a wooden stake. All set-ups were effective in detecting both predator species.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-preparation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Data preparation</h2>
<p>We first created a table of species detections and deployment information (coordinates, dates) for every camera-trap deployment. All data analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.3 <span class="citation">(R Core Team 2020)</span>. We used lorelograms to identify the minimum interval to approximate independence <span class="citation">(Iannarilli et al. 2019)</span>; this indicated 30 minutes discarding repeat detections of a species within 30 minutes was sufficient in reducing temporal autocorrelation. To account for day length variation across space and time, we extracted sunrise and sunset times for each camera-trap deployment using the ‘maptools’ R-package <span class="citation">(Bivand and Lewin-Koh 2021)</span> and adjusted detection times to be relative to sunrise and sunset using the average double anchoring approach described by <span class="citation">Vazquez et al. (2019)</span>.</p>
<p>Using the ‘reshape’ R-package <span class="citation">(Wickham 2007)</span>, we manipulated the detection table into a dataframe with a row for each hour of the day, for every camera-trap deployment, recording the total number of ‘independent’ fox and feral cat detections within each hour for the entire camera-trap survey duration.</p>
<p>We identified the broad vegetation type (Ecological Vegetation Class (hereafter ‘EVC’) group <span class="citation">(DELWP 2020)</span>) at each camera-trap location. Six vegetation types were surveyed in both regions, although to varying degrees (Table 1). In the Otway region, rainforests are interspersed (primarily in low lying gullies) throughout wet and damp forests at a finescale, and we merged these groups (hereafter ‘wet forests’).</p>
<p>For each deployment, we calculated the number of poison fox-baits within a 2.3 km radius around each camera-trap - the average maximum distance foxes in these regions travel from their home range centre <span class="citation">(Hradsky et al. 2017)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="generalised-additive-models" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Generalised additive models</h2>
<p>We modelled predator counts (response variable) with generalised additive models (hereafter ‘GAMs’) implemented in the ‘mgcv’ R-package <span class="citation">(Wood 2017)</span>. GAMs learn from the data to specify nonlinear relationships between response and explanatory variables. A maximum wiggliness is specified for each explanatory variable, with complexity automatically reduced (all the way to completely linear function) through a smoothing penalty to avoid overfitting. We used REML estimation and the negative binomial family (as overdispersion, but not zero-inflation, was initially detected with a Poisson distribution using the ‘DHARMa’ R-package <span class="citation">(Hartig 2020)</span>).</p>
<p>We specified a model offset to account for differences in camera-trap survey duration, and a random intercept for each site to account for repeat sampling. We used a duchon spline static spatial smooth to model both spatial autocorrelation and differences in predator activity across space (i.e. the effect of unaccounted for environmental covariates). For the fox model, we additionally included a thin plate regression spline for poison-bait density, with a factor smoother for each region, as bait replacement schedules differed between the regions. This formed the base model specification for each model we fitted. Models (n = 3) differed in their specification of the cyclical hour smooth in order to explore variations in (1) predator diel activity across EVC groups, (2) feral cat diel activity across the gradient of observed fox counts, as well as (3) individual feral cat diel activity, which are detailed in the sections below. We plotted models using ‘ggplot2’ and ‘gratia’ R-packages <span class="citation">(Wickham 2016, Simpson 2021)</span>.</p>
<div id="variation-in-predator-diel-activity-across-vegetation-types" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Variation in predator diel activity across vegetation types</h3>
<p>We expected the activity of each predator species to follow a broadly consistent pattern (e.g. lower during the day), but potentially have small shifts in relative activity between sunset and sunrise across the different EVC groups (1). Fitting separate responses for each EVC group would throw away shared information, which is particularly costly for the least surveyed groups, and would result in more noisy estimates. We therefore specified a global smoother for hour (i.e. average response), along with group-level smoothers with shared wiggliness for each EVC group <span class="citation">(i.e. model GS in Pedersen et al. 2019)</span>. This model structure penalises functions which deviate strongly from the average response, increasing confidence that they are true deviations opposed to the result of sampling noise.</p>
</div>
<div id="variation-in-feral-cat-diel-activity-across-apex-predator-activity" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Variation in feral cat diel activity across apex predator activity</h3>
<p>To investigate changes in feral cat diel activity in response to counts of foxes. We added an extra column to our dataframe with the number of fox detections divided by the log of the number of survey days to account for differences in camera-trap survey durations (hereafter ‘adjusted fox counts’).</p>
<p>Analysis of stage 1 showed that fox diel activity patterns in wet forests differed relative to all other EVC groups. We therefore expected feral cats might to temporally avoid foxes in a different way in wet forests than the dry vegetation groups, but that responses would be similar in all the drier vegetation groups. We therefore modelled fox-induced changes in feral cat diel activity separately for wet and dry vegetation groups. We further split dry vegetation groups by region, to examine whether patterns remained consistent across space? for spatial replication. We refer to the resulting variable as ‘habitat type’, which had three levels: wet forests of the Otway Ranges (‘wet_otways’) dry EVC groups of the Otway Ranges (‘dry_otways’) and all of the Glenelg region data (‘dry_glenelg’).</p>
<p>We used a tensor product of hour (using cyclic cubic regression spline) and log adjusted fox count (using thin plate regression spline) smooths to model feral cat diel activity across the range of observed fox activity, separately for each habitat type. We used the double penalty model selection approach, which penalises the null space in addition to the range space (i.e. shrinking wiggly terms to linear terms) of the spline basis, meaning covariate effects can be entirely removed from the model <span class="citation">(Marra and Wood 2011)</span>. This meant that feral cat activity could vary nonlinearly and be penalised consistently across both dimensions. This model specification allows five different scenarios: that there was (1) no effect of hour or foxes on feral cats (2) a static hourly effect only, (3) a spatial response to foxes only, (4) a spatial response to foxes and an unrelated static hourly effect, (5) a spatial response to foxes and a hourly effect which changes across the range of fox counts.</p>
