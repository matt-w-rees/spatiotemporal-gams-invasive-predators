abstract = {Management agencies commonly control non-native mammalian predators to protect native prey populations, but there are few robust examples of such control enhancing native prey populations. We conducted a 9-year landscape-scale management experiment to evaluate the benefits of controlling the invasive red fox (Vulpes vulpes) to low densities for three native ground-dwelling mammalian prey species—common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) and southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus)—in south-east Australian forests. We hypothesized that sustained and spatially extensive fox control would reduce fox abundance and increase occupancy, colonization and persistence rates for all three prey species in three treatment areas relative to three non-treatment areas. There was a substantial decline in bait take by foxes in treatment areas from 2005 to 2013, and fox abundances were much lower in treatment than non-treatment areas throughout the experiment. Occupancy rates of all three native prey species increased in treatment areas relative to non-treatment areas, although the magnitude of the increase varied with species, treatment area, and time. Colonization and persistence rates were not always positive for all species and all treatment areas. Our experiment demonstrates that foxes can be reduced to, and maintained at, low abundances and that this has a generally positive effect on the occupancy by small native mammalian prey species.}

abstract = {Effective invasive predator management requires accurate knowledge of population density. However, density can be difficult to estimate for wide-ranging, cryptic and trap-shy species, such as the feral cat Felis catus. Consequently, few density estimates exist for this invasive predator of global significance, particularly from rugged, mesic or structurally complex habitats where detection is challenging. In this study, we estimated feral cat density in the wet forests and cool temperate rainforests of the Otway Ranges, south-eastern Australia, to (1) provide a density estimate for this rarely surveyed habitat type, and (2) verify predictions from a continental-scale model of feral cat density. We deployed 140 camera traps across two independent 49km2 grids and identified individual feral cats based on unique pelage markings. Using spatially explicit mark-resight models, we estimated that there were 1.14 cats km−2 (95% CI: 0.89–1.47). This is more than three times the average cat density in natural environments across Australia, and at least five times higher than model-based predictions for the Otway Ranges. Such high densities of feral cats likely reflect the abundance of small native mammals and lack of apex predators in our study area. Our findings contradict the widespread assumption that feral cats occur at very low densities in mesic and rugged habitats. Underestimating the density of feral cats in these environments has significant implications for pest animal management and biodiversity conservation.}

abstract = {Abstract Camera trapping allows scientists to study activity patterns of animals under natural conditions. However, comparisons of activity patterns across seasons or latitudes can be biased, because activity is often attuned to sunrise and sunset, the timing of which varies with latitude and season. Existing transformation methods to solve this problem have limitations. Here, we explore whether and how activity patterns can be transformed more accurately using two alternative ‘double anchoring’ transformations – equinoctial and average anchoring – that anchor activity time to two chosen anchor points during the study period. Using simulated noisy datasets mimicking species with either crepuscular, diurnal or cathemeral activity patterns, we compared the ability of different transformation methods to extract the latent pattern and activity levels under different study conditions. We found that average anchoring best retrieved the original diel activity pattern and yielded accurate estimates of activity level. Two alternative transformation methods – single anchoring and equinoctial anchoring – performed less well. Bias in estimates from using untransformed clock times was most marked (up to 2.5-fold overestimation) for longer studies covering 4–5 months either side of an equinox at high latitude, and focusing on crepuscular species. We applied the average anchoring method to 9 months of data on Red deer Cervus elaphus, Wild boar Sus scrofa and Mouflon Ovis amon musimon activity as captured by camera traps in National Park Hoge Veluwe, the Netherlands. Average anchoring revealed more pronounced peaks of activity after sunset than was apparent from untransformed data in red deer and wild boar, but not for mouflon, a cathemeral species. Similarly, activity level was lower when calculated using average anchored time for red deer and wild boar, but no difference was observed for mouflon. We conclude that transformation of time might not be necessary at latitudes below 20°, or in studies with a duration of less than a month (below 40° latitude). For longer study periods and/or higher latitudes, average anchoring resolves the problem of variable day length. Code is provided. The transformation functions are incorporated in the r-package ‘activity’.},

abstract = {Summary 1 Aggressive behaviour of top predators may have strong effects on the distribution and abundance of mesopredator species. Such interactions between predator species can reduce the intensity of predation on vulnerable prey. Suppression of mesopredators by top predators is a potentially important process that could protect small prey species from unsustainable predation. 2 There is some evidence that in Australia, the dingo Canis lupus suppresses populations of the red fox Vulpes vulpes. This interaction could be significant to biodiversity conservation because while dingoes have been in Australia for several thousand years and coexist with a wide range of small mammals, the fox is a recent arrival which has caused declines and extinctions, and continues to threaten many prey species. 3 However the strength of the effect of dingoes on foxes is unclear, and some published data have been interpreted as demonstrating no relationship between abundance of the two species. These data come from forested habitats in eastern Australia, and may suggest that negative relationships of dingoes and foxes do not occur in complex habitats. 4 We re-analyse published data on fox vs. wild dog (i.e. dingoes plus, potentially, feral dogs and hybrids) abundance in eastern forests. These data reveal a triangular relationship of fox to wild dog density: when wild dogs are abundant, foxes are consistently rare, while when wild dogs are rare, foxes may be abundant but are not always so. This suggests that the abundance of wild dogs sets an upper limit on the abundance of foxes, but does not fully determine fox abundance. 5 Standard regression and correlation methods are not appropriate for analysing such triangular relationships. We apply two statistical methods that can be used to characterize the edges of data distributions, and use these to demonstrate a negative relationship of maximum fox abundance to the abundance of wild dogs. 6 Synthesis and applications. Our analysis adds to evidence that dingoes may have negative effects on red foxes in a wide range of habitats, and therefore, that dingoes may be significant to conservation of mammal biodiversity in Australia. It also illustrates problems and solutions in the statistical analysis of abundance of one species as a function of the abundance of another species with which it has a strong interaction.},

abstract = {Abstract Tools for describing correlation structures in binary data are underrepresented in the ecological literature, and methods commonly applied to continuous data are inappropriate because of intrinsic features of binary data (e.g. variance dependent on the mean). Describing how correlation changes in time and space, or in response to different stimuli, can provide insights into the ecological processes generating observed patterns. Moreover, proper modelling of correlation structures is necessary for reliably estimating covariate effects. We introduce ecologists to the lorelogram (Heagerty \& Zeger, 1998), a tool used to identify and describe dependency structures in binary data. Lorelograms can help guide data aggregation efforts to facilitate independence, or alternatively, to inform appropriate structures for modelling correlated data. We developed the r-package, lorelogram, for estimating and plotting lorelograms and show how it can be used to identify various dependency structures using simulated data. We analyse data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey and camera trap data from a carnivore study in Minnesota to demonstrate how the lorelogram can describe spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. In the latter case, we show how the lorelogram can identify short-term dependencies (e.g. individuals that linger at the camera site for several minutes), longer-term dependencies (i.e. diel activity patterns) and effects of site-specific covariates such as attractants. We then illustrate how this information can be incorporated in a modelling framework that accounts for these correlation structures (e.g. when modelling daily activity patterns). The lorelogram is a promising tool for quantifying correlation in binary data over space or time. In addition to the applications presented in our paper, it could be used to identify independent sampling units for occupancy modelling or to quantify behavioural responses to covariates such as anthropogenic stressors or recent presence of prey, predators or competitors.},

abstract = {The problem of variable selection within the class of generalized additive models, when there are many covariates to choose from but the number of predictors is still somewhat smaller than the number of observations, is considered. Two very simple but effective shrinkage methods and an extension of the nonnegative garrote estimator are introduced. The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines. The procedures are also illustrated analysing data on plasma beta-carotene levels from a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States.}
